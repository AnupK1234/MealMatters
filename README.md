<h1 align="center">MealMatters</h1>

## Introduction:

MealMatters is a webapp designed to overcome student food insecurity by connecting students with nearby restaurants that provide free meals. The webapp facilitates student registration, enabling them to view a list of nearby restaurants offering free meals and request coupons from the organization. Donors can also register for an account and make donations to the organization, which utilizes these funds to reimburse restaurants for meals provided to students. MealMatters aims to increase student access to free meals, alleviate the financial burden of food insecurity, raise awareness of the issue, and encourage support for student food insecurity initiatives.
